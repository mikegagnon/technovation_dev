  This lesson is an opportunity for students to be truly inspired and 
  encouraged to consider a career in technology, as they will now have a 
  chance to see what their mentor does in her career. Students should 
  write down questions as mentors are talking and follow-up after the 
  presentation. We hope that this activity will instill a personal 
  connection with students and mentors and foster students' interest in a 
  career in technical entrepreneurship.
