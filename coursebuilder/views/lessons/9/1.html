  This lesson covers the written portion of your app business plan. In 
  preparation for the pitch competition, you will write a business plan 
  document and also create a PowerPoint presentation pitching their app 
  company to “investors.” The business plan consists of the team name, app
  name, and member names, as well as the executive summary, company 
  summary, product description, market analysis, strategy &amp; 
  implementation plan, and financial analysis. This document will help you
  develop a comprehensive plan for your company and flesh out how your 
  app is solving their customer’s recognized problem.&nbsp;
