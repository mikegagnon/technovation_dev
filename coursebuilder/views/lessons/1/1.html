<div class="paragraph">Welcome to Technovation Challenge 2013!</div>

<div class="paragraph">We are excited that you are participating in our 12-week course, which will prepare your team to submit an original app along with video pitch and business plan. Whether you are new to programming completely or a returning Technovation alum, we are excited to embark on this journey with you.</div>

<div class="paragraph">The 12-week course starts the week of January 21. We suggest you plan for about four hours per lesson, but you are welcome to complete the course with your teams at your own pace. All deliverables are due on April 13th, 5pm PST.</div>

<div class="paragraph">In this section, we posted all the printable course materials for the Spring course. Each week's PowerPoint presentation will be posted on the task of its corresponding week. If your team did not complete Hack Day (App Inventor training) yet, you can access the tutorial instructions, questions, and PPT slides from Hack Day <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/groups/technovation-challenge-field-trips-and-hack-day/content/hack-day-tutorial-2-paintpot/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
