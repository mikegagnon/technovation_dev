  User-centered design means that the design of the app serves the user, 
  not the designer. For example, crash dummies were originally developed 
  only in the form of adult men (since they were designed by adult men 
  engineers). As a result of not designing with the user in mind, women 
  and children were injured at higher rates. Additionally, when automatic 
  faucets were first introduced they could only recognize white hands, 
  since they were designed by an all-white engineering team. Products are 
  frequently designed without the user in mind. What are some more 
  examples?

  Interface means the common boundary or link between two things. User 
  interface is the link between the person and thing. The desktop of a 
  computer is the interface between the user and the computer. User 
  Interface Design is designing things while taking into account the 
  people who use them and understanding how that user will experience the 
  product. On the slide, there is the example of the PSP that is designed 
  to maximize the screen space of the gamer; the keys are placed to be 
  convenient for the gamer. If the keys were too close together or too far
  apart, it would impede the gamerâ€™s playing ability.
