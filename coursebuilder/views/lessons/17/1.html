  The App Inventor team at MIT is dedicated to improving App Inventor to 
  best suit your needs.&nbsp;So if you ran into any problems while using 
  App Inventor, let us know by sending us an email.&nbsp;Try to be as 
  specific as possible, include screen shots, when the problem would 
  occur, and if your app crashed, please attach the source code.
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
  You can also send an email if you have any suggestions on how to make a
  feature better, any components you would like to be added to App 
  Inventor, how to make using it more intuitive etc.

<div class="paragraph strong">MERGER TOOL:</div>

<div class="paragraph">
  Would you like to merge two projects together in App Inventor? Kate 
  Feeney created this Merger tool as part of her master's thesis last year
  at Mills College. It's a wonderful way for a team to develop their app 
  collaboratively, because you can have one student developing a screen in
  one project, and another student developing a different screen in 
  another project, simultaneously. As long as these two projects (screens)
  are created within the same App Inventor account, you can merge them 
 together with this tool.

<div class="paragraph">
  Here are the&nbsp;<a href="http://iridescentlearning.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/AIMergerDocumentation.pdf">instructions</a>. Please email annalise@iridescentlearning.org if you would like us to 
send you the Merger .jar file so that you can use this tool. We aren't able to post it
online but we can email it to you.&nbsp;</div>
