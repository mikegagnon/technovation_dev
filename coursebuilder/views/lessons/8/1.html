  This lesson reinforces Technovation’s mission and vision.Technovation 
  aims to promote women in technology by giving girls the confidence and 
  expose them early to skills they need to succeed in computer science and
  entrepreneurship. We want to empower every girl with the confidence to 
  enter a career in technology and entrepreneurship. The first component 
  of this week is meant for you to speak frankly about your perceptions of
  entrepreneurs and success. In the discussion portion of this 
  presentation, we want to have you think about the personal 
  characteristics of these vastly successful people and see that although 
  they are famous, they also have characteristics that you share. We want 
  you to see that being an entrepreneur is possible when you have the 
  drive and vision.

  This lesson covers some of the basics in the business world. Following 
  the discussion on entrepreneurship, you will then learn about value 
  propositions, market size, revenue streams, cost structure, and 
  distribution channels. Revenue streams and distribution channels are 
  different in that revenue streams produce profit and distribution 
  channels help the app reach its market. Distribution channels would 
  ideally produce revenue as a result of accessing them.&nbsp;
