  This lesson supplies teams with a framework to consider when creating 
  their app idea. The critical point of this lesson is that even if a 
  product is amazing, it may fail as a business if there are no customers 
  who want it—which is why we encourage practicing Lean Thinking. Asking 
  your target customers as soon as possible for feedback on your product 
  idea allows you to “fail fast” and pivot before losing time and 
  resources.

  Customer development is another perspective to consider when designing 
  an app. Cindy Alvarez helps companies build better products through 
  intensely understanding their customers. Customer development is seeking
  to understand what the customers need, how they work, as well as what 
  their struggles and highest priorities are. Find out more about customer
  needs by surveying them -- either through Twitter, Facebook, email, or 
  in person.&nbsp;
